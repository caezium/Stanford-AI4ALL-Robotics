One trick: you can generate a token from GitHub (with repo permissions) and use it as your password. Another approach for Colab is to mount Google Drive or use Colab‚Äôs own GitHub integration. If this is confusing ‚Äì don‚Äôt worry. We will help you get set up, or we might handle pushes for you by other means if needed (e.g., maybe you just send us files to commit). Our goal isn‚Äôt to make you Git experts in one day, but to introduce the tool so you can use it."

        "- Installed/verified Python 3 on your system or confirmed the Colab environment‚Äôs Python.\n",
        "- Installed Jupyter Notebook (if working locally) or learned that Colab provides it, so you can create and run notebooks.\n",
        "- Installed Git (if needed) and learned why we use version control.\n",
        "- Cloned the workshop GitHub repository to get all necessary materials.\n",
        "- Practiced the basic Git workflow: checking status, adding files, committing changes with messages, and understanding how to push to a remote repo.\n",
        "- Explored the repository structure so you know where things are.\n",
        "\n",
        "All these tools set the stage for the core content coming up. In the next session, we‚Äôll dive into Python programming basics. You‚Äôll learn about variables, data types, functions, and more ‚Äì which are the building blocks you‚Äôll use to create AI algorithms and control robots. With your environment ready, you can code along with us.\n",

        "Finally, take a breather and pat yourself on the back for getting through the setup. üéâ Often, setting up the environment is the not-so-glamorous part of coding, but you handled it. From here on, we can focus on the fun stuff: coding, AI, and robots!\n",

        " Your To-Do: If you‚Äôre curious, you can open the next notebook (Session 3) and have a sneak peek. No need to understand it fully yet ‚Äì we‚Äôll explain everything. Or, you might try writing a simple Python program on your own as practice (perhaps using the skills from this notebook‚Äôs examples). For instance, can you modify the example.py file in the repo to print something else, and then commit that change? It‚Äôs good practice with Git.\n",
