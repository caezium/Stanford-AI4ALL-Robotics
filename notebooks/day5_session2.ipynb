        "\n",

        "- **Position control**: we tell the joint to move to a target angle. The simulator will move it as if a motor is trying to reach that angle.\n",
        "- **Velocity control**: we set a target speed for the joint to rotate.\n",
        "- **Torque control**: we directly apply a force/torque on the joint (advanced mode, not needed for now).\n",

        "For our simple two-link robot, position control is easiest to understand – we set a desired angle for each joint.\n",

If we just set a new joint target and instantly read the state, the simulation might not have progressed. We can also enable real-time simulation, but here we’ll step manually to keep control.\n"

In simpler terms, forward kinematics answers “Where is the hand if the joints are at angles θ1, θ2, ...?” while inverse kinematics answers “What joint angles θ1, θ2, ... will put the hand at position (X, Y, Z)?”.\n",
