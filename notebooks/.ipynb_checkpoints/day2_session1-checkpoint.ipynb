        "Now that our Python skills are warmed up, let's talk about Computer Vision. What is it, and why is it important in robotics?\n",
        "\n",
        "Computer Vision (CV) is a field of AI that enables computers (or robots) to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images or videos, similar to how humans use their eyes and brain. In simpler terms, it's like giving eyes to machines and teaching them to make sense of what they \"see\". This is crucial for robots that need to navigate, recognize objects, or make decisions based on their environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some core tasks in computer vision include:\n",
        "- Image Classification: Determining what an image contains (e.g., identifying if an image is of a cat or a dog). The output is a label or category for the image.\n",
        "- Object Detection: Finding and locating objects in an image (e.g., drawing a bounding box around a person in an image). The output is one or more bounding boxes and labels for each detected object.\n",
        "- Image Segmentation: Partitioning an image into segments by class, essentially classifying each pixel (e.g., coloring each pixel belonging to a cat vs background differently). This gives a precise shape outline for objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are other tasks too (face recognition, optical flow for motion, etc.), but the above are fundamental. In robotics, these tasks allow a robot to know what is in its environment and where it is, so it can act accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why is CV important for robotics? Imagine a self-driving car (a robot car) – it uses CV to detect lanes, traffic signs, pedestrians, and other cars. In our case, we are building a sorting robot. For a robot to sort objects (by color or shape), it must first see the objects and recognize their properties (like what color an object is, or where it is located). CV provides that capability. Without vision, our robot would be \"blind\" and unable to differentiate objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Relevance to Our Project: Sorting System\n",
        "\n",
        "Our final project is a robotic sorting system. In this project, the robot needs to identify objects by color and sort them into groups. We'll use computer vision techniques so that a camera can detect the color of each object and tell the robot where those objects are.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if we have an image feed from a camera looking at a conveyor belt or a table with objects, we want the computer to pick out, say, all the blue objects and maybe tell the robot arm to pick them up. Achieving this will involve some of the CV concepts we introduce today and practice in the next session:\n",
        "- Converting the camera image into a useful color representation.\n",
        "- Filtering the image to isolate a particular color (like creating a mask of just the blue areas).\n",
        "- Finding the location/shape of those areas (so the robot knows where to pick).\n",

        "## 3. Core Computer Vision Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "### Color Spaces: BGR and HSV\n",
        "When dealing with color images on a computer, each pixel is typically represented by three values (for the three primary color channels). The common color space for digital images is RGB (Red, Green, Blue). OpenCV, the library we'll use, by default uses BGR (Blue, Green, Red) – it's just the channel order that's swapped (blue first instead of red).\n",
        "\n",
        "Why different color spaces? The RGB/BGR is intuitive for display, but not always the best for processing. Another very useful color space is HSV: Hue, Saturation, Value. This corresponds more closely to how humans describe colors:\n",
        "- Hue: The actual color type (angle on the color wheel), e.g., red, green, blue, etc.\n",
        "- Saturation: How intense or pure the color is (high saturation means vivid color, low means more grayish).\n",
        "- Value: The brightness of the color (0 is black, higher values are brighter).\n",
        "\n",
        "In HSV, the hue is typically given as an angle from 0–360° (OpenCV uses 0–180, essentially half-scale), saturation and value are given as percentages 0–100% (in OpenCV these are 0–255). The benefit is that HSV separates the color component (hue) from illumination (value). This makes it easier to filter by color alone. For example, if we want to detect all green objects, we can specify a range of hue values corresponding to green and not worry as much about how bright or dark the object is.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below is a diagram of the HSV color model (often visualized as a cone or cylinder). It shows how Hue, Saturation, and Value relate to color perception:\n",
        "https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vision-processing/wpilibpi/image-thresholding.html\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "HSV color space represented as a cone: Hue corresponds to the angle (different colors around the circle), Saturation is the radius (distance from center – pale to vivid), and Value is the vertical axis (height – from dark to bright).\n",
        "\n",
        "In OpenCV, we can convert an image from BGR to HSV using a function cv2.cvtColor. We will do that in the next notebook. The key takeaway for now is: for color-based object detection, HSV is often more effective than RGB/BGR. In HSV, a range of hue values cleanly captures \"what color\" something is, while in BGR, a color is a combination of three values which can be affected by lighting. For instance, a red object in shadow (darker) still has a red hue, even if its BGR values are all lower due to less light.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Image Filtering\n",
        "Before we isolate colors, sometimes we might need to filter images. Filtering is modifying images by changing pixel values based on some criteria or neighborhood. Why filter? To enhance certain features or reduce noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "- A blurring (smoothing) filter replaces a pixel by the average of its neighbors, which can remove small noise and smooth out the image. This is useful to reduce tiny stray dots or fluctuations.\n",
        "- A sharpening filter does the opposite – it emphasizes differences (edges) to make features more distinct.\n",
        "- Edge detection filters (like the Sobel filter or Canny edge detector) find boundaries of objects by looking for rapid intensity changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In image processing terms, filtering changes the pixel values to either highlight or suppress certain details. We won't delve deep into filter algorithms today, but remember: we can preprocess images with filters to make our main task (like detecting color blobs) easier. For instance, if an image is a bit noisy, applying a blur filter before thresholding might help produce a cleaner mask.\n",
        "\n",
        "(If you're curious, blur is an example of a low-pass filter (removes high-frequency detail), and edge detection is high-pass (removes smooth background, keeps high-frequency edges).)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Thresholding\n",
        "Thresholding is a simple but powerful operation in vision. It converts an image to a binary image (just two values, commonly 0 and 255) based on a threshold condition. Essentially: if a pixel value meets a criterion, mark it as \"foreground\" (white); if not, mark it as \"background\" (black).\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, suppose we have a grayscale image (each pixel intensity from 0=black to 255=white). If we choose a threshold of 128, we can make a rule: any pixel brighter than 128 becomes 255 (white), and anything else becomes 0 (black). This will segment the image into two parts. If the image was dark background with bright objects, thresholding would ideally leave us white blobs on black background corresponding to the objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thresholding can be applied to color images too, but usually we apply it to one channel at a time (e.g., on a grayscale image or on the hue channel of an HSV image). In our project, we will threshold on the HSV representation to get only the pixels in a certain color range.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's illustrate thresholding with a very simple example using Python lists (to avoid needing an image file here). Imagine we have some brightness values and we want to threshold them:"

        "Thresholding is often used as a segmentation technique – to separate regions of interest. However, picking the right threshold is key, and in more complex images, a single global threshold might not work perfectly (there are methods like adaptive thresholding or Otsu’s method for that, but those are beyond our scope today).\n",

        "Recap: Thresholding takes us from a full-color or grayscale image to a binary mask. This mask can highlight just the parts of the image we care about (e.g., all pixels that are \"green\" within some tolerance become white).\n",
        "\n",
        "One thing to note: after thresholding, the result may have noise (extra white spots or small holes) depending on the image. There are morphological operations (like eroding or dilating the mask) that can clean up such noise if needed. If our results have noise, we might mention how to handle it, but we’ll see if it's necessary once we try on a real image.\n"
