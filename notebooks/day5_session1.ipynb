    "In this session, we interacted with our simulation:\n",
    "- Moved the robot’s base around.\n",
    "- Added a dynamic object (cube) and saw physics (gravity + collision with ground) in action.\n",
    "- Experimented with gravity settings and observed the outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these explorations, you should gain intuition about how the simulator responds to different setups. In the next day’s lessons, we will learn how to control the robot’s joints (motors) and even use inverse kinematics to reach targets. This is where simulation becomes really powerful: we can command the robot in the virtual world and test how it behaves.\n"
